## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
